Thanks to DeliriousPersona for drawing the logo circle!!
<br /> <br />
**Known Issues:** <br />
Note loading is EXREMELY un-optimized <br />
Hold-Note segments in the chart editor are not positioned correctly <br />
Offset is kind of a mess (between the chart editor and gameplay. Also multiple devices) <br />
Chart Editor is just kinda scuffed in general <br />
<br />
Don't expect any of these to be fixed soon. Or ever. I may not update this project, but if I do, I may fix these. I'm just pointing out that I know what issues there are. <br />
<br />
Thanks for reading and enjoy the game!
